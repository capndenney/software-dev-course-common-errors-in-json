üè® JSON Syntax Debugging: Hotel Booking Data
===========================================

üéØ Objective:
Students will analyze a JSON file containing multiple syntax errors,
identify the issues, and correct them.

This activity helps practice spotting and fixing common JSON mistakes such as:
- Missing commas
- Incorrect use of quotation marks
- Unmatched brackets/braces
- Trailing commas
- Invalid data types

// ============================================

/*
üìò Scenario:
You‚Äôre a developer on a team building a travel booking API.

A teammate submitted a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, 
but it contains multiple syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed.

üîß Your Task:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the provided JSON file
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify all syntax errors
3Ô∏è‚É£ Write down what each error is and why it causes a problem
4Ô∏è‚É£ Correct the JSON structure so that it is valid
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate your corrected version using a JSON linter or validator

üß™ Deliverables:
- A corrected version of the JSON
- A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary

// ============================================
// üîç Provided JSON File with Errors
// ============================================

const invalidBookingJSON = `
{
  "hotelName": "Grand City Hotel",
  "checkInDate": "2024-05-15" 
  "checkOutDate": "2024-05-20",
  "guests": [
    {
      name: "Alice Johnson",
      "age": 30,
      "email": "alice.johnson@example.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bob Smith",
      "age": undefined,
      "email": "bob.smith@example"
    }
  ],
  "roomDetails": {
    "type": "Suite",
    "pricePerNight": 200,
    "amenities": ["WiFi", "Breakfast", "Parking",]
  }
}
`;

/*
Issue Tracker:
-Missing comma after checkInDate object
-missing quotes around guests[0].name
-value of guests[1].age needs to be null, not undefined.  Undefined is not an accepted value
-roomDetails.amenities should not have a comma after "Parking"
*/


// ============================================
// ‚úÖ Requirements
// ============================================

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version
- Keep track of each fix:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong?
  ‚Ä¢ Why is it a problem in JSON?
  ‚Ä¢ What did you change to fix it?
*/


// ============================================
// ü§î Follow-Up Questions
// ============================================

/*
üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?

I went through based on what we learned first to search for errors and found 4. Once that was done, I pasted it into a JSON file with JsonLint installed to see if there were others, there were not.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?

To validate, I ran it through a json linter.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?

I didn't find any of them particularly hard to spot.  JSON has pretty straight forward rules, undefined is probably the most likely to slip through the cracks, but with the linter, its harder to miss issues.

4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)

   linters and writing using a pattern will always make it easier to write quality code the first time.
